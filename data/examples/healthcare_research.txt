The study tracked 350 patients for 12 months to evaluate telemedicine follow-ups for chronic heart failure.

Groups:
- Standard in-person care
- Weekly telemedicine monitoring with home sensors

Findings: 22% reduction in hospital readmissions for telemedicine.
Limitation: sensor accuracy declines over time.
Conclusion: telemedicine is helpful but not a total replacement.
